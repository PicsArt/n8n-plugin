# Example .npmrc file for publishing to NPM
# Copy this file to .npmrc and replace YOUR_NPM_TOKEN with your actual token
# 
# To generate a token:
# 1. Go to https://www.npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens
# 2. Click "Generate New Token"
# 3. Choose "Automation" for CI/CD or "Publish" for local publishing
# 4. Copy the token (you'll only see it once!)
#
# Note: Never commit .npmrc with real tokens to git!
# The .npmrc file is already in .gitignore

//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=YOUR_NPM_TOKEN
